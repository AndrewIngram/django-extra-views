django-extra-views - The missing class-based generic views for Django
=====================================================================

Django's class-based generic views are great, they let you accomplish a large number of web application design patterns in relatively few lines of code.  They do have their limits though, and that's what this library of views aims to overcome.

Installation
------------

Installing from pypi (using pip). ::

    pip install django-extra-views

Installing from github. ::

    pip install -e git://github.com/AndrewIngram/django-extra-views.git#egg=django-extra-views


Features so far
------------------

- FormSet and ModelFormSet views - The formset equivalents of FormView and ModelFormView.
- InlineFormSetView - Lets you edit formsets related to a model (uses inlineformset_factory)
- CreateWithInlinesView and UpdateWithInlinesView - Lets you edit a model and its relations
- GenericInlineFormSetView, the equivalent of InlineFormSetView but for GenericForeignKeys
- Support for generic inlines in CreateWithInlinesView and UpdateWithInlinesView
- Support for naming each inline or formset with NamedFormsetsMixin

Still to do
-----------

I'd like to add support for pagination in ModelFormSetView and its derivatives, the goal being to be able to mimic the change_list view in Django's admin. Currently this is proving difficult because of how Django's MultipleObjectMixin handles pagination.

Examples
--------

Defining a FormSetView. ::

    from extra_views import FormSetView


    class AddressFormSet(FormSetView):
        form_class = AddressForm
        template_name = 'address_formset.html'

Defining a ModelFormSetView. ::

    from extra_views import ModelFormSetView:


    class ItemFormSetView(ModelFormSetView):
        model = Item
        template_name = 'item_formset.html'


Defining a CreateWithInlinesView and an UpdateWithInlinesView. ::

    from extra_views import CreateWithInlinesView, UpdateWithInlinesView, InlineFormSet
    from extra_views.generic import GenericInlineFormSet


    class ItemInline(InlineFormSet):
        model = Item


    class TagInline(GenericInlineFormSet):
        model = Tag


    class CreateOrderView(CreateWithInlinesView):
        model = Order
        inlines = [ItemInline, TagInline]


    class UpdateOrderView(UpdateWithInlinesView):
        model = Order
        inlines = [ItemInline, TagInline]


    # Example URLs.
    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        url(r'^orders/new/$', CreateOrderView.as_view()),
        url(r'^orders/(?P<pk>\d+)/$', UpdateOrderView.as_view()),
    )

If you want to use granular access in templates you can name your inlines or formsets with NamedFormsetsMixin. ::

    from extra_views import NamedFormsetsMixin

    class CreateOrderView(CreateWithInlinesView):
        model = Order
        inlines = [ItemInline, TagInline]
        inlines_names = ['Items', 'Tags']

More descriptive examples to come.
