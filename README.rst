django-extra-views - The missing class-based generic views for Django
========================================================================

Django's class-based generic views are great, they let you accomplish a large number of web application design patterns in relatively few lines of code.  They do have their limits though, and that's what this library of views aims to overcome.

Installation
------------

Installing from pypi (using pip). ::

    pip install django-extra-views

Installing from github. ::

    pip install -e git://github.com/AndrewIngram/django-extra-views.git#egg=django-extra-views

.. _`Documentation`: https://django-extra-views.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

Features so far
------------------

- FormSet and ModelFormSet views - The formset equivalents of FormView and ModelFormView.
- InlineFormSetView - Lets you edit formsets related to a model (uses inlineformset_factory)
- CreateWithInlinesView and UpdateWithInlinesView - Lets you edit a model and its relations
- GenericInlineFormSetView, the equivalent of InlineFormSetView but for GenericForeignKeys
- Support for generic inlines in CreateWithInlinesView and UpdateWithInlinesView
- Support for naming each inline or formset with NamedFormsetsMixin
- SortableListMixin - Generic mixin for sorting functionality in your views
- SearchableListMixin - Generic mixin for search functionality in your views

Still to do
-----------

I'd like to add support for pagination in ModelFormSetView and its derivatives, the goal being to be able to mimic the change_list view in Django's admin. Currently this is proving difficult because of how Django's MultipleObjectMixin handles pagination.

Examples
--------

Defining a FormSetView. ::

    from extra_views import FormSetView


    class AddressFormSet(FormSetView):
        form_class = AddressForm
        template_name = 'address_formset.html'

Defining a ModelFormSetView. ::

    from extra_views import ModelFormSetView


    class ItemFormSetView(ModelFormSetView):
        model = Item
        template_name = 'item_formset.html'

Defining a CreateWithInlinesView and an UpdateWithInlinesView. ::

    from extra_views import CreateWithInlinesView, UpdateWithInlinesView, InlineFormSet
    from extra_views.generic import GenericInlineFormSet


    class ItemInline(InlineFormSet):
        model = Item


    class TagInline(GenericInlineFormSet):
        model = Tag


    class CreateOrderView(CreateWithInlinesView):
        model = Order
        inlines = [ItemInline, TagInline]


    class UpdateOrderView(UpdateWithInlinesView):
        model = Order
        inlines = [ItemInline, TagInline]


    # Example URLs.
    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        url(r'^orders/new/$', CreateOrderView.as_view()),
        url(r'^orders/(?P<pk>\d+)/$', UpdateOrderView.as_view()),
    )

If you want more control over the names of your formsets (as opposed to iterating over inlines), you can use NamedFormsetsMixin. ::

    from extra_views import NamedFormsetsMixin

    class CreateOrderView(NamedFormsetsMixin, CreateWithInlinesView):
        model = Order
        inlines = [ItemInline, TagInline]
        inlines_names = ['Items', 'Tags']

You can add search functionality to your ListViews by adding SearchableMixin and by setting search_fields::

    from django.views.generic import ListView
    from extra_views import SearchableListMixin

    class SearchableItemListView(SearchableListMixin, ListView):
        template_name = 'extra_views/item_list.html'
        search_fields = ['name', 'sku']
        model = Item

In this case ``object_list`` will be filtered if the 'q' query string is provided (like /searchable/?q=query), or you
can manually override get_search_query method, to define your own search functionality.

Also you can define some items  in ``search_fields`` as tuple (e.g. ``[('name', 'iexact', ), 'sku']``)
to provide custom lookups for searching. Default lookup is ``icontains``. We strongly recommend to use only
string lookups, when number fields will convert to strings before comparison to prevent converting errors.
This controlled by ``check_lookups`` setting of SearchableMixin.

Define sorting in view. ::

    from django.views.generic import ListView
    from extra_views import SortableListMixin

    class SortableItemListView(SortableListMixin, ListView):
        sort_fields_aliases = [('name', 'by_name'), ('id', 'by_id'), ]
        model = Item

You can hide real field names in query string by define sort_fields_aliases attribute (see example)
or show they as is by define sort_fields. SortableListMixin adds ``sort_helper`` variable of SortHelper class,
then in template you can use helper functions: ``{{ sort_helper.get_sort_query_by_FOO }}``,
``{{ sort_helper.get_sort_query_by_FOO_asc }}``, ``{{ sort_helper.get_sort_query_by_FOO_desc }}`` and
``{{ sort_helper.is_sorted_by_FOO }}``

More descriptive examples to come.
